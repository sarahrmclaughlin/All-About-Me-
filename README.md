# All-About-Me-

#### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! SalutðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·! CiaoðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹! I am Sarah McLaughlin, not to be confused with the (**AMAZING**) chanteuse.
- I consider myself a collector of languages; from utilising Copilot in VScode for code optimisation to learning how to say "please" and "thank you" in 10+ languages or practicing French and Italian daily.
- :woman_technologist: At work, I am an Analytics Engineer for Data Science, which means I translate business problems into data models that can be used by data scientists. With a background in statistics, I understand the needs and what data will be meaningful.
- ðŸ—º In my free time, I like to travel and have been to 18 different countries. I love to learn, which means I have also been to more museums than I can even remember.
- :seedling: When I'm home, I volunteer at local food banks and also with 'The Nature Connection', bringing the outside world to those who are unable to experience it on their own. 
- Volunteerism is extremely important to me. When I was younger, I spent a lot of time volunteering at the Buffalo Zoo. It taught me to be comfortable with public speaking and tailoring my conversations to different audiences. I bring a lot of this experience to my work as well. 
- ðŸ“° During the pandemic, I volunteered with The Covid Tracking Project at the Atlantic and was even published in an article for my contributions! 

- I love to chat about a variety of topics (data, pop culture, the weather) and my current obsessions are:
- 1. All things ```mlflow``` + Evidently AI
- 2. Buying books to build up my home library. (My latest purchase was 'The Neopolitan Novels'.)
